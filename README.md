# Foqal Policies
Like [Github](https://github.com/github/site-policy), we want to make our policies, procedures, guidelines and statements available 
for collaborative development. We created this repository as a place for people to use, modify, propose edits, or help us work on 
our policies and procedures. While this is our official repository, these may not reflect the policies of our products or website 
as we need to do additional legal reviews and update the website independently. They should however be close.

# What do I do?
We are offering these policies under [CC0-1.0](#license). You can apply these policies in part or in whole and you can make required 
changes as they apply to your product or service. Just remember to remove references to Foqal and our products and services.

## Make them even better
Found a typo? Found a way to simplify the language or make it more clear and understandable? Great, fix it and create a pull 
request or simply open an issue. We will fix it or apply your patch when we can. 

# Why?
Why not? This was originally thought of as a resource for startups that are already strapped for cash to be able to reduce some legal 
costs. You should however (as we do) review all policies and statements with a lawyer before applying them to your website or products.

We also plan to use this to provide transparency as we make changes to our own policies.
